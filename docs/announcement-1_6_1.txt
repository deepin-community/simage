simage 1.6.1 Released
=====================

Preamble
--------

simage is a multiplatform library capable of loading, manipulating and
saving images, creating and saving movies (AVI and mpeg), and loading
audio. The simage library relies heavily on 3rd party libraries to
perform these tasks.

simage is part of the Coin3D family of libraries
<http://www.coin3d.org> created by Systems In Motion
<http://www.sim.no>.

New in this release
-------------------

New in v1.6.1 (2004-10-08):
* Switched resize filter from Lorenz3 to Bell filter to avoid
  some unwanted artifacts when resizing images.

Release 1.6.1 is a micro-release.  It does not contain any API/ABI-
changes from the preceding version.  It only contains internal changes
and bugfixes.

Download instructions
---------------------

We will regularly package up new bugfix releases of the simage library
into source code archives for distribution on the FTP site whenever we
feel this is justified by the number and/or severity of the fixed
bugs. This also goes for updated binary installation packages.

Precompiled for MS Windows:
  Visit http://www.coin3d.org/ and download the "Coin3D for Windows" 
  installation package.  A new installer that incorporates this version
  of simage may not happen in the immediate future.
